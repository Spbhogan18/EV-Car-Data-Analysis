## Project Description

This project provides an interactive dashboard to explore, analyze, and visualize electric vehicle (EV) data. It aims to offer insights into trends — such as adoption rates, geographic distribution, charging infrastructure, battery performance, or other EV-related metrics (depending on the data) — enabling users, stakeholders or researchers to draw meaningful conclusions.  

The dashboard is designed for analysts, policymakers, automotive researchers, or anyone interested in understanding EV data patterns.

## Dataset & Data Sources

- **Source(s):** e.g., (CSV files, public datasets, survey results, or API exports — add actual source names / URLs)  
- **Description:** A brief summary of what the dataset contains (e.g., vehicle registrations, charging station logs, battery health records, regional data, timestamps).  
- **Date Range:** (e.g., 2015–2025)  
- **Geographic Coverage:** (e.g., global / country / state / city-level — specify)  
- **Any preprocessing / cleaning done:** (e.g., removed duplicates, handled missing values, normalized units)

## Dashboard Overview

- The dashboard is available via Tableau (public link).  
- It includes (but is not limited to) the following visualizations / analysis:  
  - Time-series trends (e.g., EV adoption over time)  
  - Geographic distribution / maps (if location data is available)  
  - Comparison between EV performance metrics (e.g., battery status, charging times)  
  - Histograms / distributions of key variables  
  - Any interactive filters / slicers (year, region, vehicle type, etc.)  
---

## How to Use

1. Open the public Tableau link in a browser.  
2. Use filters / controls on the dashboard to explore the data (e.g., select region, year, vehicle type).  
3. Hover or click on charts/points to get detailed info (tooltips, legends).  

---

## Requirements

- Tableau Public / Tableau Desktop (version X.X or newer) to view or edit the dashboard.  
- Web browser (modern, with JavaScript enabled) for viewing the public dashboard.  
- (If using raw data) Python/R or any data-processing tool (optional) for preprocessing.
